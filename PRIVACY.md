# Privacy Policy for X-Follow Assistant Pro

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

## Introduction
X-Follow Assistant Pro ("we", "our", or "the Extension") is a Chrome Extension designed to help users manage their X (Twitter) followers locally. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## Data Collection and Usage

**1. No Personal Data Collection**
The Extension operates entirely on your local device (client-side). We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data, login credentials, or browsing history to any external servers or third parties.

**2. Local Storage**
The Extension uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) for the sole purpose of:
*   Saving your user preferences (e.g., batch intervals, blue tick settings).
*   Storing a local history of operations (e.g., "Followed user X", "Unfollowed user Y") to provide you with an activity log.
*   Caching data about non-followers to prevent repetitive processing.

This data never leaves your browser and is deleted when you uninstall the Extension or clear your browsing data.

**3. Permissions**
*   **Host Permissions (`https://x.com/*`, `https://twitter.com/*`)**: Required to inject the automation script that interacts with the buttons on the page (Follow/Unfollow) on your behalf.
*   **Storage**: Required to save your settings locally as described above.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics).

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
